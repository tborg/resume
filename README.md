# Trevor Borg's resume

My resume is a yaml file rendered with Vue.js.

Mostly for the sake of checking out a new toy.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install yarn -g
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn run dev

# build for production with minification
yarn run build

# run unit tests
yarn run unit

# run all tests
yarn test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
