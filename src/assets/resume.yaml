      **I work on a large single-page web application.** I specialize in the social
      ad management platform, our SaaS product's critical revenue stream.

      When I started at 4C we were called VoxSup and operated on biweekly meetups
      in a Northwestern professor's office. As of late 2016 I have nearly 200
      coworkers with offices from Seattle to New York, London to Eindhoven. In
      that time I have had the opportunity to **lead every new social advertising
      partner API integration.**

      Products at 4C focus on **the intersection of TV and social media**. The ad
      management platform delivers automation tools for delivering the right
      message at the right time to the right people. The same tools are enabled
      across **all major social ad publishers**, integrated into our standard platform.

      As the partners multiply so do the ingredients in 4C's special sauce. I designed
      and built key parts of the **reporting and automation infrastructure**. I wrote
      browser-based tools for transforming ad hierarchies **to and from Excel
      spreadsheets**. I helped write and maintain libraries for **bulk-editing** data grids
      in our Ember frontend.

      I do a lot of things at 4C so I hand a lot of things off. This has put me
      in a position to **mentor** a number of junior developers. Keeping up with
      people is just as much of what I do as keeping up with javascript.
